                Meet Dusty! Dusty is a stunning 5-year-old Russian Blue with a silvery-blue coat that’s as soft as
                velvet. Known for their quiet, intelligent nature, Dusty is a bit on the shy side at first but quickly
                warms up to those who earn his trust. Once he’s comfortable, he’ll shower you with affection, purring
                contently as he snuggles beside you. Dusty enjoys a peaceful environment and would thrive in a calm,
                loving home where he can relax and enjoy his people’s company. If you’re looking for a beautiful, loyal
                companion who loves a good cuddle but also enjoys his personal space, Dusty might be your perfect match.

                peaceful environment and enjoys being around his humans, though he’s never demanding. Theo would be a
